# Text-Extractor-from-Image-and-PDF
The code uses openCV and pytesseract to extract the text and tkinter is used as the GUI to give the code a visual factor.

text_reader.py contains the code


1.jpg, 2.jpg and sample_pdf are test cases u can use to test the code.

1.jpg contains a clear image whereas 2.jpg is a slightly blurred version of 1.jpg which has been used to check the accuracy of the code.
